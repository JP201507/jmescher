jmEscher is a Java library for creating and interactively manipulating 2D constrained Delaunay triangulations that can be used to form 3D meshes.

An implementation of Lawson's incremental insertion algorithm performs the Delaunay triangulation. In addition, constraint insertion and removal, non-convex boundaries, and vertex removal and relocation are supported.
